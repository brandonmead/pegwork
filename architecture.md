# Pegwork architecture

Purpose: durable reference facts for the Pegwork plugin (envs, packaging, decisions, gotchas). Last verified: 2026-10-17.

## Product
- Pegwork (full name "Pegwork Platform for WordPress"): one WordPress plugin, an application builder: content builder (JetEngine-like CPTs, fields, taxonomies, relationships), listings/templates, filters (JetSmartFilters-like), form builder (Gravity Forms-like), automation builder (Salesforce Flow-like), all on one schema registry.
- First site: SI for Good (sibling folder `../SIforGood`, private repo brandonmead/siforgood).
- Main long-term consumer: BarnCRM for WordPress (separate add-on plugin requiring core). BarnCRM Salesforce edition: github.com/Nonprofit-Collaborative/BarnCRM (Apache-2.0).

## Canonical sources
- BMemory is canonical: `specification/wordpress-platform-plugin.md`, `decision/wordpress-platform-plugin-packaging.md`. Local docs are copies.
- Phase 1 technical design: `docs/phase-1-design.md` (approved 2026-10-17).

## Packaging
- One plugin with switchable modules.
- Add-ons only for: BarnCRM for WordPress, third-party integrations, paid extras if open core.

## Rendering
- Standard WordPress blocks (any block theme).
- Divi 5 path for other existing sites later.

## Versions and Phase 1 owner decisions
- PHP minimum 8.2. WordPress minimum 6.7.
- Schema files win over DB.
- Description of 50-300 words blocks publish/pending (drafts exempt).
- License: GPL-2.0-or-later (decided 2026-10-17; BMemory `decision/wordpress-platform-plugin-license.md`). BarnCRM for WordPress also GPL; BarnCRM Salesforce edition stays Apache-2.0.

## Name and identifiers (final, decided 2026-10-17)
| Thing | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | Pegwork ("Pegwork Platform for WordPress") |
| Slug, text domain | `pegwork` |
| Main file | `pegwork.php` |
| Function, hook, option prefix | `pegwork_` |
| Constant prefix | `PEGWORK_` |
| PHP namespace | `Pegwork\` (public API `Pegwork\Api`) |
| WP-CLI | `wp pegwork` |
| Future REST namespace | `pegwork/v1` |
| Repo | `brandonmead/pegwork` (private for now) |
| License | GPL-2.0-or-later |
- Likely-free domains at naming time: pegwork.org, pegworkwp.com, getpegwork.com (not registered).

## Repo
- GitHub `brandonmead/pegwork` (private for now). Local folder `/Users/bmead/Documents/Mead Drive/AI Stuff/Claude/Claude Code Projects/Pegwork` (main checkout); session worktrees under `~/worktrees/pegwork/`.

## Dev environment
- LocalWP site `siforgood`: domain siforgood.local, path `~/Local Sites/siforgood`, PHP 8.2.29, nginx, MySQL 8.4. Created 2026-10-17 via Local's GraphQL API.
- Plugin symlinked: `wp-content/plugins/pegwork` -> `~/worktrees/pegwork/pr1-scaffold` (repoint when that worktree is removed). Theme repo not yet linked.
- WP-CLI: `wp` needs Local's PHP 8.2 (`~/Library/Application Support/Local/lightning-services/php-8.2.29+0/bin/darwin-arm64/bin/php`) with `-d mysqli.default_socket=<socket>`; socket `~/Library/Application Support/Local/run/iKB6dEYW-m/mysql/mysqld.sock`. WP_DEBUG is off in wp-config; force it per run with `--exec="define('WP_DEBUG',true);"`.
- Tests: local DB `pegwork_tests` (root/root, same socket), emptied each run. Run with `WP_CORE_DIR=<core copy> WP_TESTS_DB_HOST="localhost:<socket>" vendor/bin/phpunit` (wp-phpunit + `tests/wp-tests-config.php`). CI uses `bin/install-wp-tests.sh` and `WP_TESTS_DIR`.

## Tooling
- PHPUnit 9.6 (WP 6.7 test suite rejects PHPUnit 10+), yoast/phpunit-polyfills 3, WPCS 3, PHPCompatibilityWP 2.1 (PHPCompatibility 9.3.5; 10.x still alpha). `composer.lock` resolved for platform PHP 8.2.
- CI matrix PHP 8.2/8.4 x WP 6.7/latest, MySQL 8.0 service; runner needs `subversion` for the install script.
- Verified 2026-10-17: `register_meta` `label` arg present in WP 6.7, absent in 6.6; `registerBlockBindingsSource` public in 6.7.
- WP admin user `admin`. Password not stored: use Local's one-click admin or `wp user update`.

## Gotchas
- Folder is under Mead Drive (synced), which creates "<name> 2.<ext>" duplicates, even inside .git. Stage with explicit paths, never `git add -A`.
